#### Welcome to my blog:)

In this blog, I will write some book reports, methods of learning foreign languages as well as IT-projects. Here you can also find information about the Chinese language and culture which I made for especially Europeans who are working with Chinese technology or industrial companies. Also, I am glad to share my life experience and some very interesting high-tech news about the Chinese market which you will not easily find on other local media.

The name CB is for two meanings, the first is Crazy Bunny, and the second is Chinese Blogger. The Crazy Bunny is a sweet rabbit with very long ears from my neighbor and he always amuses me. So I decided on this name as my blog name. I come from China and of course, I am a Chinese Blogger.

I use this blog to record my life and find friends who focus on the same areas. I have been living in Europe since 2014. Besides Chinese and English, I know German very well and try to learn some French and Spanish. 

Now, enjoying your reading time!
